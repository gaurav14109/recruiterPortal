There should be a login page for two entities namely AccountManager and Recruiter. 
Account Manager will receive a new job whenever company recruiter has posted on the portal.
Account Manager then assign few recruiters from all recruiters to working on this job.
Then, Recruiter can start working on this job or else reject it with feedback.
